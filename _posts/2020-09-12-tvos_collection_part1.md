Since their introduction in iOS 6 collection views have been an essential tool in the Apple developer toolbox. At the time of this writing (iOS 14 beta 8), though, the recently introduced SwiftUI does not provide any kind of native collection.

When evaluating SwiftUI as a viable option for porting our iOS project to tvOS, I went through many ups and a few (nasty) downs I decided to share as a series of articles:

- Part 1: _Flirting with SwiftUI Collections_: A mild introduction into the world of collections in SwiftUI (and associated delusions).
- Part 2: _Building a SwiftUI Collection_: Where we build a SwiftUI collection from the ground up, piece by piece.
- Part 3: _A SwiftUI Collection Polishing_: Where a few implementation issues are solved.

This series of articles assumes some prior SwiftUI and UIKit knowledge.

# Part 1: Flirting with SwiftUI Collections

In its first iteration SwiftUI did not offer any native collection view like UIKit does, though it was possible to create fairly complex collection layouts using a combination of nested stacks and scroll views.In its second iteration SwiftUI intends to further close the gap with UIKit by introducing lazy stack variants as well as new lazy grid components.

Building grid layouts in SwiftUI is incredibly simple. If you haven't, just try and you'll be amazed how simple and beautiful the formalism is. And with the additions made this year, there hasn't been any better time to fully embrace SwiftUI, has there?

That's what I initially thought, though things didn't turn out quite exactly as I imagined in the first place.

## Love at First Sight

Think about the TV+, App Store or Netflix apps. It is fairly common to present content in horizontally scrollable shelves, and coincidentally this is how we present content in our apps.

How would you write such a layout in SwiftUI? Well, last year you would simply nest a few stacks and scroll views, and _voil√†_:

```
struct Cell: View {
    let row: Int
    let column: Int
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("\(row), \(column)")
            .frame(width: 320, height: 180)
            .background(Color.blue)
    }
}

struct Row: View {
    let index: Int
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView(.horizontal) {
            HStack {
                ForEach(0..<10) { i in
                    Cell(row: index, column: i)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

struct Grid: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            VStack {
                ForEach(0..<20) { i in
                    Row(index: i)
                }
            }
        }
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
        .ignoresSafeArea(.all)
    }
}
```

Achieving a similar result with UIKit would probably have required a `UICollectionView` as well as a compositional layout with horizontally scrollable sections, requiring much more code to write. And this of course assumes your application targets iOS or tvOS 13+: On earlier versions you would rather have used a main vertical collection or table, containing as many nested horizontal collections as needed for rows. Not to mention that in this case horizontal content offsets need to be saved and restored as the main vertical collection or table is scrolled and cells are reused.

The real downside of this SwiftUI implementation is that, unlike `UICollectionView`, all view bodies are loaded initially, as is appearant when you profile the code with Instruments:

## Romance

The greatness thankfully does not stop there. This year SwiftUI introduces lazy variants of stacks in iOS and tvOS 14. Seems like magic when you watch [WWDC 2020 10031](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10031) where they are presented in action, but you still have to be somewhat careful about which stack you promote to laziness (note this is one of the rare cases where laziness can be considered a motive for promotion).

In our case only the outermost stack should be made lazy so that each row height can be properly calculated by the layout engine:

```
struct Cell: View {
    let row: Int
    let column: Int
    
    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {}) {
            Text("\(row), \(column)")
                .frame(width: 320, height: 180)
                .background(Color.blue)
        }
    }
}

struct Row: View {
    let index: Int
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView(.horizontal) {
            HStack {
                ForEach(0..<10) { i in
                    Cell(row: index, column: i)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

struct Grid: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            LazyVStack {
                ForEach(0..<20) { i in
                    Row(index: i)
                }
            }
        }
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
        .ignoresSafeArea(.all)
    }
}
```

When profiled with Instruments we clearly see that only visible views are taken into account:

[Pretty cool, huh?](https://youtu.be/ZHthpkzErKw?t=91). 

### Remark

Though iOS and tvOS 14 also introduce lazy grids with similar behavior, those are not suited for our layout as they currently do not support independently scrollable rows.

## Drama

I had never been happier since I discovered my new friends the SwiftUI stacks and scroll views. But now was time to scroll the content, and this is where our romance ended.

What is not immediately apparant if you don't run the code samples above on tvOS is that you cannot actually scroll the content. There is namely no [focusable](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/tvos/app-architecture/focus-and-selection) item, therefore no way to navigate the collection with the Apple TV remote.

Fortunately it is very easy to make cells focusable by turning them into buttons. We can even have standard look and feel with the new tvOS 14 [card button style](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/cardbuttonstyle), which makes focused buttons pop out with a large shadow underneath and the ability to tilt the view by gently touching the remote.

Since focus makes the button larger and adds a large shadow to it, I tweaked the margins to let the content shine when focused, but otherwise the layout is quite the same as the one above, except for an added button wrapper:

```
struct Cell: View {
    let row: Int
    let column: Int
    
    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {}) {
            Text("\(row), \(column)")
                .frame(width: 320, height: 180)
                .background(Color.blue)
        }
        .buttonStyle(CardButtonStyle())
    }
}

struct Row: View {
    let index: Int
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView(.horizontal) {
            HStack {
                ForEach(0..<10) { i in
                    Cell(row: index, column: i)
                }
            }
            .padding([.leading, .trailing], 40)
            .padding(.top, 20)
            .padding(.bottom, 80)
        }
    }
}

struct Grid: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            VStack {
                ForEach(0..<20) { i in
                    Row(index: i)
                }
            }
        }
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
        .ignoresSafeArea(.all)
    }
}
```

We can now navigate the collection and enjoy the native tvOS behavior we expect according to the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/tvos/overview/focus-and-parallax), but the experience felt a bit sluggish overall.

![Lazy stack grid](/images/focusable_grid.jpg)

As it is not uncommon for our app to present 20 shelves of 20 items, I got a bit greedy and attempted to load 20 rows of 50 columns instead. I know how important collections are in the iOS and tvOS ecosystems, and I took for granted that SwiftUI would internally perform all necessary optimizations to have great performance when nesting stacks. It turns out this is not the case at the moment, with performance clearly degrading as the number of items increases.

Furthermore, when using a `LazyVStack` for the outermost stack, navigation on tvOS is especially cumbersome when reaching the screen edges, as the focus can only be moved one row at a time.

### Remark

If you run the same code on iOS (without the card button style which is available for tvOS only), the experience is better overall:

- Scrolling is smoother, which does not mean that it is anywhere the performance of a `UICollectionView` displaying the same number of items. Without having the time to dig into what actually makes things worse on tvOS, I conjecture that issues are related to tvOS focus changes, which trigger `@Environment` updates probably leadint to additional layout work. This is something we will discuss again in part 2 of this series. If my intuition is correct we can probably expect performance improvements in the future.
- There is no issue when reaching lazy stack boundaries, as there is no focus involved.

On iOS you can also observe slight view pop-in at screen boundaries when scrolling fast.

## Breakup

To achieve the needed layout I sadly realized that nested stack and scroll views are not appropriate and fail to deliver a satisfying user experience scaling well with increased number of items. This is where I had to choose the attitude to adopt next:

- Blissful optimism: Do nothing, continue to work with nested stack and scroll views, and hope that later iOS and tvOS betas fix the issue.
- Complete pessimism: Consider SwiftUI is not mature enough and just use UIKit.
- Moderation: Keep SwiftUI, but find a way to solve collection performance issues. Report the performance issue to Apple and hope they will look into it someday.

Having tasted how great SwiftUI can be the idea of dropping it entirely was not an option, especially knowing it can be integrated with UIKit fairly easily. So I decided to opt for moderation. More about it in part 2.

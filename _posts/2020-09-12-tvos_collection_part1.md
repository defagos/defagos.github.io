Since their introduction in iOS 6 collection views have been an essential tool in the Apple developer toolbox. At the time of this writing (iOS 14 beta 8), though, the recently introduced SwiftUI does not provide any kind of native collection. In parallel, UIKit collection view has received some of its most important enhancements in iOS 13, like diffable data sources and compositional layouts, making it more appealing than ever.

When evaluating SwiftUI as a viable option for porting our [iOS apps](https://github.com/SRGSSR/playsrg-apple) to tvOS, one of the most important requirements to satisfy was to ensure grid layouts, used throughout our implementation, would be possible in a SwiftUI port. I initially and naively thought so, but I didn't quite imagine where it would lead me in the end.

SwiftUI being a nascent framework I thought sharing my findings and development process could be helpful to other developers considering SwiftUI for their own apps. Since the material to be covered is larger than initially expected, I opted out for a series of three articles requiring some SwiftUI and UIKit knowledge, but which I tried to keep as inviting as possible for newcomers:

- Part 1: _Flirting with SwiftUI Collections_: A mild introduction into the world of collection aleternatives in SwiftUI (and associated delusions).
- Part 2: _Building a SwiftUI Collection_: Where we build a SwiftUI collection from the ground up.
- Part 3: _A SwiftUI Collection Polishing_: Where a few implementation issues are solved.

# Part 1: Flirting with SwiftUI Collections

In its first iteration SwiftUI did not offer any native collection view like UIKit does, though it was possible to create fairly complex collection layouts using a combination of nested stacks and scroll views. In its second iteration SwiftUI intends to further close the gap with UIKit by introducing lazy stack variants as well as new lazy grid components. These cannot be seen as true `UICollectionView` equivalents, but SwiftUI makes it easy to build user interfaces with small bricks and expand from there.

Using only basic SwiftUI views building grid layouts in SwiftUI is in fact incredibly simple. If you haven't, just try and you'll be amazed how clean and beautiful the formalism is. And with the lazy view additions made this year, there hasn't apparently been any better time to fully embrace SwiftUI, has there?

## Love at First Sight

Think about the TV+, App Store or Netflix apps. It is fairly common to present content in horizontally scrollable shelves, and coincidentally this is how we present content in our apps.

How would you write such a layout in SwiftUI? Well, last year you would simply nest a few stacks and scroll views, and _voil√†_:

```
struct Cell: View {
    let row: Int
    let column: Int
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("\(row), \(column)")
            .frame(width: 320, height: 180)
            .background(Color.blue)
    }
}

struct Row: View {
    let index: Int
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView(.horizontal) {
            HStack {
                ForEach(0..<10) { i in
                    Cell(row: index, column: i)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

struct Grid: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            VStack {
                ForEach(0..<20) { i in
                    Row(index: i)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Achieving a similar result with UIKit would have usually required a `UICollectionView` as well as a compositional layout with horizontally scrollable sections, requiring much more code to write. And this of course assumes your application targets iOS or tvOS 13+: On earlier versions you would rather have used a main vertical collection or table, containing as many nested horizontal collections as needed for rows. Not to mention that in this case horizontal content offsets need to be saved and restored as the main vertical collection or table is scrolled and cells are reused. All these behaviors are provided for free with the above layout code, which is quite amazing in itself.

The real downside of the above SwiftUI implementation is that, unlike `UICollectionView`, all view bodies are loaded initially, as is appearant when you profile the code with Instruments:

Surely this is not optimal from a performance and memory consumption point of view, and fortunately Apple's engineers probably thought the same.

## Romance

This year SwiftUI introduces lazy variants of stacks in iOS and tvOS 14. Seems like magic when you watch [WWDC 2020 10031](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10031) where they are presented in action, but you still have to be somewhat careful about which stacks you promote to laziness.

In our case only the outermost stack should be made lazy so that each row height can be properly calculated by the layout engine:

```
struct Cell: View {
    let row: Int
    let column: Int
    
    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {}) {
            Text("\(row), \(column)")
                .frame(width: 320, height: 180)
                .background(Color.blue)
        }
    }
}

struct Row: View {
    let index: Int
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView(.horizontal) {
            HStack {
                ForEach(0..<10) { i in
                    Cell(row: index, column: i)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

struct Grid: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            LazyVStack {
                ForEach(0..<20) { i in
                    Row(index: i)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

When profiled with Instruments we clearly see an improvement. [Pretty cool, huh?](https://youtu.be/ZHthpkzErKw?t=91)

### Remark

Though iOS and tvOS 14 also introduce lazy grids with similar behavior, those are not suited for our shelf-based layout as they currently do not support independently scrollable rows.

## Drama

I had never been happier since I discovered my new friends the SwiftUI stacks and scroll views. But now was time to scroll the content, and this is where our romance ended.

What is not immediately apparant if you don't run the code samples above on tvOS is that you cannot actually scroll the content. There is namely no [focusable](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/tvos/app-architecture/focus-and-selection) item, therefore no way to navigate the collection with the Apple TV remote.

Fortunately it is very easy to make cells focusable by turning them into buttons. We can even have standard look and feel with the new tvOS 14 [card button style](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/cardbuttonstyle), which makes focused buttons pop out with a large shadow underneath and tilting superpowers.

Since focus makes the button larger and adds a large shadow to it, I tweaked the margins to let the content shine when focused, but otherwise the layout is quite the same as the one above, except for an added button wrapper:

```
struct Cell: View {
    let row: Int
    let column: Int
    
    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {}) {
            Text("\(row), \(column)")
                .frame(width: 320, height: 180)
                .background(Color.blue)
        }
        .buttonStyle(CardButtonStyle())
    }
}

struct Row: View {
    let index: Int
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView(.horizontal) {
            HStack {
                ForEach(0..<10) { i in
                    Cell(row: index, column: i)
                }
            }
            .padding([.leading, .trailing], 40)
            .padding(.top, 20)
            .padding(.bottom, 80)
        }
    }
}

struct Grid: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            VStack {
                ForEach(0..<20) { i in
                    Row(index: i)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We can now navigate the collection and enjoy the native tvOS behavior we expect according to the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/tvos/overview/focus-and-parallax), but the experience feels a bit sluggish.

![Lazy stack grid](/images/focusable_grid.jpg)

As it is not uncommon for our app to present 20 shelves of 20 items, I got a bit greedy and attempted to load 20 rows of 50 columns instead. I know how important collections are in the iOS and tvOS ecosystems, and I took for granted that SwiftUI would internally perform all necessary optimizations to have great performance when nesting stacks and scroll views. It turns out this is not the case at the moment, with performance clearly degrading as the number of items increases.

Furthermore, when using a `LazyVStack` for the outermost stack, you see that something does not feel right with navigation on tvOS. When reaching the screen edges the focus can namely only be moved one row at a time, which is far from the polished user experience you expect on Apple devices.

### Remark

If you run the code above on iOS (without the card button style which is available for tvOS only), the experience is better overall:

- Scrolling is smoother, which does not mean that it is anywhere the performance of a `UICollectionView` displaying the same number of items.
- There is no issue when reaching lazy stack boundaries, as there is no focus involved.

On iOS you can also observe slight view pop-in at screen boundaries when scrolling fast. 

Without having the time to dig into what actually makes things worse on tvOS, I conjecture these issues are related to tvOS focus changes, which trigger `@Environment` updates probably leading to additional layout work. This is something we will discuss again in part 2 of this article series, but if my intuition is correct we can probably expect some performance improvements in the future.

## Breakup

This is when I realized that achieving a shelf-based layout on tvOS in SwiftUI would not be as easy as I imagined it in the first place. Nested stack and scroll views currently fail to deliver a satisfying user experience, even with a reasonable number of items displayed. 

I reported this issue to Apple, knowing it might probably not make it into iOS 14, and considered the available options:

- Blissful optimism: Do nothing, continue to work with nested stack and scroll views, and hope that later iOS and tvOS betas fix the issue. If not, put an upper bound on the amount of content we display in grids until some version fixes performance issues.
- Complete pessimism: Consider SwiftUI is not mature enough and use UIKit.
- Compromise: Write the app as much as possible in SwiftUI but, since grids are used everywhere in our apps, find a way to solve collection performance issues.

Having tasted how great working and thinking in SwiftUI can be, the mere idea of dropping it entirely was disappointing, especially knowing it can be integrated with UIKit fairly easily. So I decided to go with the compromise and roll my own collection.
